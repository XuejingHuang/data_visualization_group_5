Dataset: Spotify Songs

- We will also be downloading our own spotify data.

10 Nov 2021. What is your topic? What issues or questions are you addressing? What is the source of the data you will be using? What statistical techniques do you think you may be using? Be as specific as possible; your github repo readme.md should be about a couple of paragraphs.

We want to analyse the most popular songs, the different genres, what makes a song popular and other things. Ideally we will use our own data in combination with the dataset and analyse our listening patterns.
